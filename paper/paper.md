# Summary

The "tga_data_analysis" package automates the data analyis of large datasets from thermogravimetric analysis. The tool can perform the following analyses: proximate, oxidation, solid distillation, peak deconvolution, and KAS kinetics. Compared to the traditional time-consuming manual analyses, this tool reduces analysis time, avoids human-errors, and promotes standardization and replication. This package also aims at becoming an open-source hub where additional physical models that rely on thermogravitric data can be developed, reviewed, and shared with the community.

# Statement of need

Thermogravimetry is extensively used
